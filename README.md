## Objective
My objective is to build a career in digital forensics and incident response, where I can apply my skills in threat analysis, evidence collection, and investigation to help organizations detect, contain, and recover from cyber incidents. I am committed to continuous learning, developing practical projects, and staying ahead of evolving threats to contribute effectively to cybersecurity teams.
